    <h2 class="c-faqs__headline">General</h2>
    <ul class="c-faqs">
      <li class="c-faq c-faq--active">
        <span class="c-faq__title">What are the RetroOlympics?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">The RetroOlympics are a competitive retro gaming tournament originating from RetroAchievements that is being streamed on Twitch. Initially created by VoiceOfAutumn with the help of Searo, it is now hosted by a large team of volunteers. The competition mostly takes place within RetroAchievements supporting emulators. Starting in 2023, we are looking into the support of other emulation such as Fightcade and other potential platforms.</div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">How do I join the RetroOlympics?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">Anyone that has a RetroAchievements account can participate in the tournament. It does not matter how long you have been a member. The RetroOlympics currently take place once per year and once you can sign up, this will be communicated on the both the RetroOlympics and RetroAchievements website.</div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">What does the tournament look like?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">In general the RetroOlympics are divided into a group stage and a knock-out stage. Each week players will battle against other players in a wide variety of retro games. The format changes each year. Previous editions were individual matches or nationality based. In the 2023-2024 season, players can sign up as a team of 3 players and compete within the usual group stage & knock-out format. </div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">
          <span class="c-faq__title">What's different this year?</span>
          <div class="c-faq__answer">The format of a group and knock-out stage will remain in the 2023-2024 season. However, this year the competition will be 3 on 3 battles. You can sign up with 2 other players and create your own team once signups are opened. If you don't have a team and can't find one, you can also register as a flex player. We will then put you into contact with other flex players so you can register. Apart from that, instead of having 3 players all play the same game, each week will have 3 different games. Each player can only play one game, so find a team with a wide skillset! Finally, starting in 2023, we will be increasing the usage as FightCade and (very occasionally) other external platforms.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">What can I win?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">Apart from the honour of being among the greatest retro gamers on this planet, winners will obtain a site badge on RetroAchievements. Additionally, each year we are looking into the possibilities of additional prizes. This year this includes an community-sponsored prize pool.</div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">What does the community-sponsored prize pool look like?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">This year, we are starting experimenting with the impact of a monetary prize pool and its effect on the competition. We have received an generous amount of donations which we narrowed down to a prize pool of $100, divided as following:
          <br />
          • 1st place team: $45 (15x3)
                  <br />
                  • 2nd place team: $30 (10x3) 
                  <br />
                  • 3rd place team: $15 (5x3)
                  <br />
                  • Groups MVP: $5
                  <br />
                  • Knock out MVP: $5
