        <span class="c-faq__title">What do I do when there is an alligator in my neighborhood?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">In many cases, if left unmolested, alligators eventually will retreat to more preferred habitats away from people. However, if you encounter an animal that poses a threat to human safety:
  <br />
  DON’T – swim outside of posted swimming areas or in waters that might contain large alligators.
          <br />
  DO – swim with a partner within all marked swimming areas. These areas are specifically situated and designed to reduce potential alligator/human conflicts.
          <br/ >
  DON’T – swim at night or dusk when alligators most actively feed.
