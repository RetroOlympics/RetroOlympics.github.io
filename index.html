    <h2 class="c-faqs__headline">General</h2>
    <ul class="c-faqs">
      <li class="c-faq c-faq--active">
        <span class="c-faq__title">What are the RetroOlympics?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">The RetroOlympics are a competitive retro gaming tournament originating from RetroAchievements that is being streamed on Twitch. Initially created by VoiceOfAutumn with the help of Searo, it is now hosted by a large team of volunteers.</div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">How do I join the RetroOlympics?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">Anyone that has a RetroAchievements account can participate in the tournament. It does not matter how long you have been a member. The RetroOlympics currently take place once per year and once you can sign up, this will be communicated on the both the RetroOlympics and RetroAchievements website.</div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">What does the tournament look like?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">In general the RetroOlympics are divided into a group stage and a knock-out stage. Each week players will battle against other players in a wide variety of retro games. The format changes each year. Previous editions were individual matches or nationality based. In the 2023-2024 season, players can sign up as a team of 3 players and compete within the usual group stage & knock-out format. </div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">
        <li class="c-faq">
          <span class="c-faq__title">What's different this year?</span>
          <div class="c-faq__answer">The format of a group and knock-out stage will remain in the 2023-2024 season. However, this year the competition will be 3 on 3 battles. You can sign up with 2 other players and create your own team once signups are opened. If you don't have a team and can't find one, you can also register as a flex player. We will then put you into contact with other flex players so you can register. Apart from that, instead of having 3 players all play the same game, each week will have 3 different games. Each player can only play one game, so find a team with a wide skillset!</div>
        </li>
        <span class="c-faq__title">What can I win?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">Apart from the honour of being among the greatest retro gamers on this planet, winners will obtain a site badge on RetroAchievements. Additionally, each year we are looking into the possibilities of additional prizes. When these prizes occur, this will be communicated.</div>

    <ul class="c-faqs">
      <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">What do I do when there is an alligator in my neighborhood?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">In many cases, if left unmolested, alligators eventually will retreat to more preferred habitats away from people. However, if you encounter an animal that poses a threat to human safety:
  <br />
  DON’T – swim outside of posted swimming areas or in waters that might contain large alligators.
          <br />
  DO – swim with a partner within all marked swimming areas. These areas are specifically situated and designed to reduce potential alligator/human conflicts.
          <br />
  DON’T – swim at night or dusk when alligators most actively feed.
  </div>

If either Prince were to travel by air or train to an official engagement, these costs would be met from public funds.</div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">

        <div class="c-faq__answer">Yes, you can use someone else’s urine in our kit. We just ask that you be 110% sure the urine is clean before you use their urine. If you do use someone else’s urine simply collect the sample the day of your test and inject it into The Whizzinator with the refill syringe. Use the sample that day.</div>

        <span class="c-faq__title">Do I have to be fat to do sumo?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">No, you do not have to be fat. In fact, most of the very successful sumo wrestlers, both professional and amateur, are not fat, by any standard. Generally, if you are athletic, you can do well in sumo. Of course, fat or skinny, big or small, you are welcome to participate in sumo.</div>

      <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">Can pregnant woman bellydance too?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">Of course, pregnant women find belly dancing excellent prenatal exercise because it strengthens the pelvic muscles and loosens up the abdominal area. It strengthens back and leg muscles, which are very critical for a woman to carry her pregnancy well.</div>
