    <h2 class="c-faqs__headline">General</h2>
    <ul class="c-faqs">
      <li class="c-faq c-faq--active">
        <span class="c-faq__title">What are the RetroOlympics?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">The RetroOlympics are a competitive retro gaming tournament originating from RetroAchievements that is being streamed on Twitch. Initially created by VoiceOfAutumn with the help of Searo, it is now hosted by a large team of volunteers.</div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">How do I join the RetroOlympics?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">Anyone that has a RetroAchievements account can participate in the tournament. It does not matter how long you have been a member. The RetroOlympics currently take place once per year and once you can sign up, this will be communicated on the both the RetroOlympics and RetroAchievements website.</div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">What does the tournament look like?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">In general the RetroOlympics are divided into a group stage and a knock-out stage. Each week players will battle against other players in a wide variety of retro games. The format changes each year. Previous editions were individual matches or nationality based. In the 2023-2024 season, players can sign up as a team of 3 players and compete within the usual group stage & knock-out format. </div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">
        <li class="c-faq">
          <span class="c-faq__title">What's different this year?</span>
          <div class="c-faq__answer">The format of a group and knock-out stage will remain in the 2023-2024 season. However, this year the competition will be 3 on 3 battles. You can sign up with 2 other players and create your own team once signups are opened. If you don't have a team and can't find one, you can also register as a flex player. We will then put you into contact with other flex players so you can register. Apart from that, instead of having 3 players all play the same game, each week will have 3 different games. Each player can only play one game, so find a team with a wide skillset!</div>
        </li>
        <span class="c-faq__title">What can I win?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">Apart from the honour of being among the greatest retro gamers on this planet, winners will obtain a site badge on RetroAchievements. Additionally, each year we are looking into the possibilities of additional prizes. When these prizes occur, this will be communicated.</div>

      <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">How do you referee the results of the competition?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">A referee will be watching the screens of all participants for any forms of an unfair advantage. We will be recording/streaming all gameplay. In the event that the results are unclear, a referee will specify that he/she needs to use the recording to determine the results and will let those be known at a later time.</div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">I don’t agree with the decision of a referee, what can I do?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">In case you don’t agree with the decision of a referee, you are free to let your dispute be known to one of them. They will further review the results with your considerations in mind, and will announce any new results if applicable.</div>
      </li>
      <li class="c-faq c-faq">
        <span class="c-faq__title">Can I play with a substitute?</span>
        <div class="c-faq__answer">No. By normal ruling, if one of your players is not present, this will count as a loss for the game this player would've played. In rare cases where one of your players is unable to make it due to unforeseen circumstances, contact a referee for the possibilities.</div>
