- Find a suitable design that can hold games per week and is interactable to view the challenge and save file (maybe card system like the teams section) - VOICE

Volunteers:

- Will no longer hold any text, needs a resizing of the wheel and a way to hold multiple wheels, as we have more volunteers than these. Can be either selecting a new wheel with an arrow or multiple on the page. No idea how <3 - DRISC
