To Do List:

Index:

- Adjust colouring of the FAQ  - VOICE

Teams:

- Track teams knocked out in JSON data, add group for past teams with knocked out dates, sorted by most recently knocked out - BUG

Standings: 

- Two tables per row and prepare page to handle multiple rows. Adjust design to be more compact - DRISC

Schedule:

- Adjust icons to be more stylized like back of player card stickers - VOICE
- Adjust table to be more wide so it covers the entire table without sidescroll - DRISC
- Make page handle multiple tables (will have one table per week, long list) - DRISC

Games:

- Find a suitable design that can hold games per week and is interactable to view the challenge and save file (maybe card system like the teams section) - VOICE

Volunteers:

- Will no longer hold any text, needs a resizing of the wheel and a way to hold multiple wheels, as we have more volunteers than these. Can be either selecting a new wheel with an arrow or multiple on the page. No idea how <3 - DRISC
